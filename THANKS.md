# THANKS

The fakechroot project was started as dirty hack because I've got an access
to some system without root privileges. I really wanted to install additional
software and I imagined that no access to the root account should be no
problem at all.

For years, more and more people started to use the fakechroot.

I would like to thank to:

* Marcin Jakubowski, for an inspiration
* Joost Witteveen, for his fakeroot
* Lionel Tricon, for an exclude path list feature
* Mark Eichin, for countless patches with bugfixes
* Martin Pitt, for great Ubuntu support
* Daniel Kahn Gillmor, for testing
