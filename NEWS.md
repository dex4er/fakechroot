## Version 2.20

UNRELEASED

* The `fts64_*` functions were added: glibc supports them since 2.23.
* The `chroot`(8) wrapper and `fakechroot`(1) command can work with POSIX
  shell.
* The `fakechroot`(1) command now supports an environment variable called
  `FAKECHROOT_NOEXPAND_SYMLINK_TARGET`, which disables path expansion on
  the targets of symlink syscalls. This more closely resmebles traditional
  `chroot` behavior, which treats the target of a symlink as an opaque
  string rather than a path.

## Version 2.19

20 Nov 2016

* The `FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH` list has to contain at most 100 elements.
* The `env`(1) wrapper works with dash.
* The `fakeroot`(1) works if `chroot`(8) is invoked twice.
* Fixes were made for `chdir`(2). It was possible to change to a directory
  outside of fakechroot.
* The `fakechroot`(1) command sets `FAKECHROOT_CMD_ORIG` environment variable
  for wrapped command.
* The `ldd`(1) wrapper distinguishes different paths with the same beginning.
* The `ldd`(1) wrapper does not fail if the path is not existing outside
  fakechroot.
* Can be compiled with clang 4.0.

## Version 2.18

26 Oct 2015

* The `fakechroot`(1) command accepts new option `--bindir`.
* The `chfn`(1) command runs correctly on Ubuntu vidid and Debian stretch.
* The `env`(1) wrapper works correctly if there is variable with multilined
  content.
* New functions `ldaddr`(3) and `dl_iterate_phdr`(3) were added. The
  `dlopen`(3) function was fixed. The `java`(1) command should work correctly.
* New functions `posix_spawn`(3) and `posix_spawnp`(3) were added. Some new
  applications like `clang`(1) should run properly.
* Fixes were made for `lstat`(2) and `lstat64`(2) functions. The ending
  slash is not removed by normalization of a path name.
* Fixes were made for `readlink`(2) function. The `fakechroot`(1) command runs
  properly with `libjemalloc` library.
* The tilde `~` character in `FAKECHROOT_*` variables is not expanded anymore.
* Fixes were made for `getpeeraddr`(3) and `getsockaddr`(3) functions.

## Version 2.17.2

24 Dec 2013

* Fixes were made for `fakechroot`(1) command with `-h` option.
* The path for function `chroot`(2) is sanitized so it works correctly when
  path is ended with `/`.
* The `make -n test` was fixed and doesn't call any command.

## Version 2.17.1

5 Dec 2013

* The `fakechroot`(1) command runs proper wrapper rather than original
  command, if it is listed on `FAKECHROOT_CMD_SUBST` variable.
* Fixes were made for `chroot`(8) wrapper. It scanned /etc/ld.so.conf
  incorrectly and now enters to physical path, avoiding symlinks.
* The `chroot`(2) function allows to use more than 2048 bytes for
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

## Version 2.17

24 Nov 2013

* The `FAKECHROOT_ELFLOADER` environment variable changes the default dynamic
  linker.  The `fakechroot` script provides `--elfloader` option.
* The `FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATH` environment variable overrides the default
  settings.
* The `ldd`(1) wrapper can work if overridden with `FAKECHROOT_CMD_SUBST`
  environment variable.
* New `env`(1) wrapper was added.  It preserves fakechroot environment even
  for `--ignore-environment` option.
* The special environment `none` means that no environment settings are loaded
  at all.
* The function `setenv`(3) and `unsetenv`(3) was reimplemented, to prevent
  problems with binaries which brings own implementation of these functions.
* New function `clearenv`(3) was added.  It preserves fakechroot environment.
* It is safe to use relative paths which won't escape from fake chroot.
* Fixes were made for `readline`(2) function if destination path is similar to
  `FAKECHROOT_PATH`.
* Fixes were made for `mktemp`(3) function if used on a path in
  `FAKECHROOT_EXCLUDE_PATHS`.
* The `_xftw64`(glibc) function is reenabled. It had wrong wrapper.
* Fixes were made for `__realpath_chk`(glibc) function when `__chk_fail`
  function is missing.
* New functions `mkostemp`(3), `mkostemp64`(3), `mkostemps`(3),
  `mkostemps64`(3), `mkstemps`(3) and `mkstemps64`(3) were implemented.
  It fixes `sed -i` command.

## Version 2.16

11 Dec 2011

* The fakechroot script loads additional environment settings from
  configuration directory (`--config-dir` option). By default additional
  settings are provided for `chroot`(8) and `debootstrap`(8) commands.
* Wrapped `chroot`(8) command loads `ld.so.conf` paths to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
  environment variable.
* The `debootstrap`(8) command works with default, buildd and minbase
  variants.
* Fixes were made for `getpeeraddr`(3) and `getsockaddr`(3) functions.
  `lwp-request` command is working correctly.

## Version 2.15

29 Sep 2011

* New function `faccessat`(2) was added.  It fixes `test -r` command.
  Thanks to Johannes Schauer.
* The `popen`(3) function were reimplemented based on OpenBSD source to
  prevent some coredumps with newer GNU C Library.

## Version 2.14

18 Dec 2010

* The source code was refactored: all functions was moved to separated files.
* The `opendir`(3) function is compiled only if it doesn't call other function
  internally.  It fixes `opendir`(3), `fts_open`(3) and `ftw`(3) functions.
* The `fts_*`(3) functions were reimplemented based on OpenBSD source.
* The `ftw_*`(3) functions were reimplemented based on GNU C Library source.
