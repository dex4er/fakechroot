[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dex4er/fakechroot.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dex4er/fakechroot)


What is it?
===========

fakechroot runs a command in an environment were is additional possibility to
use `chroot`(8) command without root privileges.  This is useful for allowing
users to create own chrooted environment with possibility to install another
packages without need for root privileges.


How does it work?
=================

fakechroot replaces some libc library functions (`chroot`(2), `open`(2), etc.)
by ones that simulate the effect of being called with root privileges.

These wrapper functions are in a shared library `libfakechroot.so` which is
loaded through the `LD_PRELOAD` mechanism of the dynamic loader.  (See
`ld.so`(8))

In fake chroot you can install Debian bootstrap with `debootstrap` command. In
this environment you can use i.e. `apt-get`(8) command to install another
packages. You don't need a special privileges and you can run it from common
user's account.
