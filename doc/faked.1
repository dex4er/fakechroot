.SH NAME
faked \- daemon that remembers fake ownership/permissions of files
manipulated by fakeroot processes.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B faked
.B [\-\-debug] [\-\-foreground] [\-\-cleanup] [\-\-key
.IB msg-key ] 
.B [\-\-load] [\-\-save-file
.IB save-file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
If a fakeroot process wants to change the ownership of a file, then
.B faked
is the process that remembers that new owner. If later the same
fakeroot process does a stat() for that filename, then the libfakeroot
wrapped stat() call will first ask faked for the fake ownership etc
of that file, and then report it.

.SH BUGS
None so far. Be warned, though: although I've written quite a few much
larger (and smaller) programs, I've never written anything that was
as tiny as
.BR fakeroot ,
had as many bugs as
.BR fakeroot ,
and still was as usable as, say, 
.BR fakeroot
version 0.0_3, the first version that could be used to build itself.
