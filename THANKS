The fakechroot project was started as dirty hack because I've got an access
to some system without root privileges. I really wanted to install additional
software and I imagined that no access to the root account should be no
problem at all.

I'm glad to see that fakechroot had found another purposes:

  * to be a part of Klik application installer (http://klik.atekon.de)
  * to be a supporter for pbuilder building system
    (http://pbuilder.alioth.debian.org/)

I would like to thank to:

  * Marcin Jakubowski <user@debian.pl>, for an inspiration
  * joost witteveen <joost@rulcmc.leidenuniv.nl>, for its fakeroot
  * Lionel Tricon <lionel.tricon@free.fr>, for an exclude path list feature
  * Mark Eichin <eichin@metacarta.com>, for countless patches with bugfixes
  * Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@ubuntu.com>, for great Ubuntu support
  * Daniel Kahn Gillmor <dkg-debian.org@fifthhorseman.net>, for testing
